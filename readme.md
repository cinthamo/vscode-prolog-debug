# VS Code Prolog Debugger

This VS Code extension allows you to debug Prolog programs.

**Prolog Debug** supports *step*, *continue*, *breakpoints*, *exceptions*, and *variable access*.

## Usaging Prolog Debugger

* Install the **Prolog Debug** extension in VS Code.
* Create a new 'program' file `readme.md` and enter several lines of arbitrary text.


* Switch to the debug viewlet and press the gear dropdown.
* Select the debug environment "Mock Debug".
* Press the green 'play' button to start debugging.

You can now 'step through' the `readme.md` file, set and hit breakpoints, and run into exceptions (if the word exception appears in a line).



## Build and Run

* Press `F5` to build and launch Mock Debug in another VS Code window.
* In the explorer view of the new window open the 'program' file `readme.md`
* Set some breakpoints
* From the editor's "Run and Debug" toolbar dropdown menu select "Debug File"
